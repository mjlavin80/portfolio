<p class='infoE'><a class='link' href="https://eac85.github.io/synthesis-2/"> <strong> A dataset that you manipulated or queried using Python</strong></a>
I manipulated the data for the stacked bar graphs. I think something that was lost in making the changes was that I had to
shrink the human populations by dividing it by the population of the bee colonies. I think this made it very hard to visualize
and ruined some of the direct impact. Since the data is not bee population, it's colony population, the comparisons are off. The main idea is that human population is increasing while the bees are decreasing, but it is hard to visualize how dramatic the increase is without the bee population looking non-existent.

<p class='infoE'><a class='link' href="https://eac85.github.io/synthesis-2/"> <strong> An example of how you made a choice related to visualization type</strong></a> The same graphs as the last one. I chose the stacked bar graph because I knew that it would be able to show and compare two different values in the same graph. My original idea was to do a pictograph because I think that would do a much better job showing the ratios of the bee colonies to the human population. I looked around for a good base example, but I struggled to find one that was intuitive enough for me to use. I think my lack of skills hurt me in this area. I feel very experienced with plot.ly and mat plot lib. But less so with D3 and JQuery, which is what the pictograms mainly used.

<p class='infoE'><a class='link' href="https://eac85.github.io/FinalProject/"> <strong> An example of how you made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other design elements</strong></a> This is my final project/revision so I am going to explain the choices I chose to make. I liked the design of the first one, but I had to make some changes. I chose to make my visualizations larger because that was part of the feedback I received. I also decided to do some things to make it look neater. I changed the background color, I chose a calmer font, and I made the visualizations look cleaner. I did this for my target audience so it would be easier to look at interpret. When a lot is going on but the focus is not on the data, it can be confusing to determine the point that is being made. I chose to include a champagne glass in the heading to relate to the bourgeouis and the speed dating concept. I added another chart so the viewer could visualize all of the careers next to each other without salary. </p>

<p class='infoE'><a class='link' href="https://eac85.github.io/FinalProject/"> <strong> An example of how you made a choice related to comparing one thing to another</strong></a> I chose to compare hometown incomes in a scatter plot based on expected happiness. My thought was that it would reveal if a part of your upbringing could be related to how successful speed dating will be. In my head, I thought maybe that lower incomes would be less happy because they expect deeper connections (all speculation), but it turns that most people just put 5 because it is easy. I think maybe if I used more of the data set (I only used waves 1-5), there would be a bigger representation. </p>


<p class='infoE'><a class='link' href="JsPie.html"> <strong> An example of something that frustrated you or took a larger amount of time than you would have liked</strong></a> When you embed a plotly plot it slows the whole page down so for this revision project I wanted to manipulate the javascript code for it. I got it running and all of the pie charts on the page, but they would not align in the center. And then when I tried to use the slider and change their visibility/display, it would not work. Since they were all in their own divs and I was just trying to change the display to none, I do not know why it did not work. But I tried for hours before giving up. I tried again the next day before going back to what I know how to do. I really wish that I knew how to fix it, but it seemed like a problem that I would not find a direct solution to on my own.

<p class='infoE'><a class='link' href="https://eac85.github.io/FinalProject/"> <strong> An example of something you are particularly proud of
</strong> </a> I really enjoy this project and all of the improvements I have made to it. I think it started out strong and the changes I made, made it that much better. I like that I use python, html, and javascript to make it a complete website. I first started learning HTML in the beginning of this year and to see how far I have come without a whole lot of involved practice is nice. And I think I have even more pride because I learned how to do it on my own. The class provided structure, but it was up to me to figure out. For further work, I would use the javascript I learned to make websites.
