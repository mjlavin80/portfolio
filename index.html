<header> Data set manipulated using Python </header>
<br/>
<p1> <a href=" http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html">Texas Department of Criminal Justice.</a> "Executed Offenders." Death Row Information. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Feb. 2017. 
<br/>
<br/>
By manipulating this data, I made it easier for an audience to interpret it. Online, there are 10 total columns in the data set. That's a lot of information to interpret in one sitting. By narrowing it to one column -- just race -- I synthesized the information into something that was easier to comprehend and understand. </p1>

<br/>
<p2> I would change this visualization to a pie chart so the number of each race on death row is more visually defined. As a bar graph, it looks like each race is equally represented out of the total number of offenders executed. As a pie chart, I think the numeric differences would be better defined since it would be represented as a percentage, not a total. </p2>

<br/>
<br/>
<p3> Usually in heat maps, the darker the color, the more dense a population is on the map. The colors here are kind of random -- there's lots of green, purple and yellow -- so an audience might not be able to see the density of executed offenders in Texas per county. I would revise it by making it different opacities of the same color for experts, and I would add a legend with what each opacity means for those who aren't experts. </p3>

<header> Comparing one thing to another </header>
<br/>
<img src = timeline.png>
<br/>
<p4>  I chose this particular comparison of offenders executed per year and news events about Texas executions to see if there was a connection between what was happening outside of Texas death row and the number of people executed in the state. I think this comparison was effective because it showed the connection between the law and the number of people executed, but I wish I had more historical information from 1996 to 2005, because that part of the timeline has a large gap in it. </p4>

<br/>
<header> Something that frustrated you </header>
<br/>
<p5> Putting together the bar graph for Synthesis 1 -- as mentioned in the visualization type section -- took a long time since I didn't know how to get the categorical information -- the races -- into something numeric that Python could interpret and make into a visualization. I overcame this obstacle by talking to the professor to see how I can do that. I learned that itâ€™s always better to ask for help than to struggle by yourself. That only leads to frustration. </p5>

<br/>
<header> Something you're proud of </header>
<br/>
<p6> I'm proud of the Texas execution per county Bokeh map -- as mentioned in the choice related to color section -- because it was the first project I worked on where I needed minimal help from the instructor. </p6>
