            <h1 style="font-family:Verdana;margin-left:25%;padding:1px;">Capstone Portfolio: Semester Reflections</h1>

            <div class="fancy"> 
            <p class="tab">Over the course of the semester, I learned more than I had ever imagined about coding, data analysis, and visualization. Here is a small snapshot of my work--linked in the sidebar--as well as a few final thoughts about my work:</p>

            <ul class='list'>
            <li class='list'><b>For</b> my Synthesis Two project, I created my own dataset of sentiment words (positive or negative) associated with tweets containing the words 'obamacare' or 'trumpcare.' However, while creating this dataset, I lost some metadata that I ended up wishing I had when creating my visualizations--specifically a time-stamp. Since my Python code analyzed each tweet and wrote only the sentiment itself to an output file, I was unable to create a chart that showed how the sentiment was changing over the time period where I was collecting each tweet. If I had had that information, I would have been able to create an animated line graph of the sentiment as it came in, and I think that would have been a much better choice for the data than my pie charts.</li>

            <li class='list'><b>The</b> second link is to one of a few word clouds I created for my Synthesis One assignment. I chose to use a word cloud to show the most common words used in speeches by a few political leaders: Mussolini, Trump, Hitler, and Franco. Had I not used a word cloud, however, I probably would have chosen a bar graph that displayed each word as a bar with the length of the bar measuring the frequency of the word in relation to other words. This change would have allowed the viewer to see the relationship between words and their frequencies more clearly, because the bars would have been placed next to each other. Instead, my word cloud could prove hard to understand since so many of the sizes of words are varied throughout the entire cloud. In the future, I may add on a bar chart to each political leader's page to make the analysis clearer, but I would definitely leave the word cloud up for its more fun visual aspect.</li>

            <li class='list'><b>For</b> the Team 2 Project, I was tasked with the creation of the base HTML and CSS code. Since our project was so closely related to the city of Pittsburgh, I chose to use colors and fonts that I felt really represented the city: black and gold, in particular! If I were to revise this work for an expert in our topic, I would probably tone down the obnoxious black and gold colors, however, because they may serve as a distraction to the overall work we put into visualizing the data itself. If I were to revise the design of the page for someone who knew very little about our topic, I would also tone down the color scheme to make it easier to focus on the data visualization. When trying to understand complex data, I find it often helps to have a more minimalist approach when it comes to color and design, and I think my imagined audience would feel the same.</li>

            <li class='list'><b>When</b> comparing the word frequencies of all of the political leaders mentioned in my Synthesis One project, I chose to include a Lexical Dispersion Plot as well as word clouds for my visualizations. I chose this particular comparison to emphasize the similarity in word choice between the four leaders. However, I think that my visualization could use a few tweaks. Instead of displaying the four plots as a slideshow, in the future I would chose to overlay all of the datasets onto one chart using multiple colors to distinguish each speaker. This way, the minute differences between each of the speakers would be more pronounced, helping to emphasize my point that each of them used many of the same words in their speeches.</li>

            <li class='list'><b>One</b> of my greatest frustrations of this semester was the creation of the linked pie chart for my Synthesis Two assignment. At first, I had intended on creating a line plot of each tweet as positive or negative over time, but I discovered very late that my dataset was not compatible with that particular visualization. Unfortunately, I did not realize this until the day before the project was due, when my instructor kindly pointed it out to me. Luckily, I was able to create this pie chart with little to no difficulty, but I was and am still frustrated that it took me so much work to come to that conclusion. Procedurally, I learned through this experience to try and find a new set of eyes when the code just will not work. Even if it is just a simple syntax error staring you in the face, it is better to accept the shame I may feel from being stuck and actually reach out for help. After all, no one knows it all!</li>

            <li class='list'><b>Lastly</b>, I have linked to the Python file I created for the Synthesis Two assignment. I am particularly proud of the word classifier I built for this assignment, voted_classifier; it used a combination of other classifiers in the NLTK in order to work, and although it took about 45 minutes for it to compile the first time, I am definitely glad I was able to complete it!</li>
