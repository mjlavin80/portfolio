  <h1>Final Portfolio</h1><br>
  <h4>An example of something that frustrated you or took a larger amount of time than you would have liked. How did you finally overcome this obstacle, or when did you know it was time to move on? What did you learn, procedurally, from this obstacle?</h4> 
  <p> In my synthesis 2 assignment, one of the biggest obstacles I have encountered is being able to make a colorful plot.ly graph by manipulating the code provided online (https://plot.ly/python/line-and-scatter/), specifically In[4]. I have thought to be make a scatter plot that has an increasing of differed in colors of popularities of movies. I actually got inspired by the scatterplot I found on this site and manipulate the provided code on Jupiter notebook to create a color effect on a scatter graph. However, the problem is Jupiter Notebook crashed my whole webpage and is not allowing me to open the notebook with that specific code that I successfully manipulated.  </p>
  
  <p>I would go through my code a little. I still do not understand what my mistake is. I am going through one of the files in my synthesis-2 folder, the try-out-graph.ipynb. So I actually did not do much but try to replace the x and y axis from my datasets. Then, I also add encoding into the csv file that I used. I am actually unsure what encoding=latin-1 means and I have tried to look on the internet to find out an answer and I am not completely sure what it means. My personal guess is it has to be with some type of arrangement of the csv dataset. I do not remember clearly why I add the encoding right after the csv, I think it may have linked with the display of information and the observation in other codes. I also rename all the part that I believe should be linked back to my datasets. The biggest problem is once I log into my plot.ly to run my code in the Jupyter Notebook, it worked but then it crashed. </p>

  <p>In general after multiple trials and errors and time limited, I did not get the chance to figure out more of the problem of my code. I then find out more about plot.ly and able to create a scatter graph from it but it is not the one that is with my preference in which It would be great to show it in python codes. I do not know whether I have used the wrong code from the site or not. But I remember only seeing a glimpse of the successful graph for just a second and it just crashed the whole Jupyter Notebook unfortunately. What I have learned from this obstacles is to be able to learn about how to manipulating code in a correct way, even though it is still an obstacle for me, I am more aware of it now and when I may encounter the similar issue, I would first of all know immediately what I need to change first besides the x and y axis, but also to pay attention to the renaming and so it is compatible with my datasets. I would love to hear any suggestion and recommendation from Professor Lavin if you have spotted this strange obstacles that I have been encountering.  </p>

  <p>Thank you!  </p>
