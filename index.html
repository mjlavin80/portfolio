          <h1>The End</h1>
        	<div class="cool1">
        	<h3>Data</h3>
 				<p>For both synthesis projects, I used the
 				<a href="https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/">
 				Million Song Dataset</a>. Specifically, for
 				<a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/synthesis-2-revision/data-representation/">
 				synthesis 2</a>, I took the data, made it into
 				lists, then grouped it in a way that I 
 				was able to see the amount of the word
 				"love" in song titles for years 1930-2010.</p>
 				<br>
 				</p>While it's a cool representation, it
 				totally leaves out the individual titles of
 				the songs, which would be cool to look at and
 				compare how each one uses "love," for example.
 				</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>When this class started, I had no idea
 				what data I wanted to use — or even the
 				importance of raw data, really — so I don't
 				think I particularly wish that I did
 				anything differently. This data was cool and
 				I'm happy with what I was able to produce with
 				it.</p>
 				<br><br>
 			<h3>Visualization Choice</h3>
 				<p>When I originally couldn't get the line
 				graph to work for synthesis 2, I was thinking
 				of trying to do a bar graph instead. That
 				way, it would still show the amount of
 				"love"s in songs by year. However, I didn't
 				think it would be able to show the progression
 				over time as well as a line graph, so I
 				worked really hard to make it work the way
 				I wanted it to, and I think the visualization
 				was successful in that way.</p>
 				<br><br>
 			<h3>Design Choice</h3>
 				<p>I got some (well-deserved) flack for my
 				color scheme choice for my <a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/skills/">
 				skills development assignment</a>. However,
 				I didn't choose these colors for no reason.
 				Since this assignment was all about our
 				learning and personal growth, and was all
 				personal, basically, I thought it would
 				make the most sense to design the site in
 				variations of my favorite color: pink. I think
 				it looks cute, and it's <b>my</b> growth/learning
 				that was documented on this site, so I went with
 				it.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>I know it doesn't make sense to make
 				every project in my favorite color, but I
 				think there is a time and a place! So, for the
 				<a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/synthesis-2-revision/artist-statement/">
 				revision of synthesis 2</a>, I used an online
 				tool called <a href="https://coolors.co/">
 				"Coolors"</a> to help me choose a cohesive
 				set of colors. I didn't want to pick something
 				that was <b>too</b> neutral and boring, because
 				that's not who I am as a person, plus music
 				data and titles isn't super serious data. I
 				wanted this to be kind of playful. I don't think
 				it's too bright, but you are free to disagree.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>If I was presenting this to a music expert,
 				if those exist or need specific qualifications,
 				I'm not sure if I would change the colors or not.
 				I think bright colors put people in a good mood,
 				so I wouldn't want to make it more dull or muted,
 				especially since musicians tend to be more creative
 				and would probably appreciate my "wacky" colors.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>Someone like a business man, for example, who
 				probably doesn't know much about the technicalities of
 				music, still probably listens to the radio — at least —
 				on his way home from work and hears the pop music and
 				the love songs and every thing in between and can still
 				probably see the data in the same way despite the site
 				being a little bit bright. That being said, I stand by
 				my color choices!</p>
 				<br><br>
 			<h3>Comparisons</h3>
 				<p>In synthesis 2, I compared the use of the word
 				"love" in song titles to the year in which the songs
 				were written. This is because I noticed in 
 				<a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/synthesis-1/data-representation/">
 				synthesis 1</a>, where I made a word cloud displaying
 				the most popular words among the song titles, that the
 				word "love" was the most frequently used word in the
 				titles included in the dataset. I wondered if this was
 				something that was always true, or if it evolved over time,
 				so I wanted to compare the frequency by year.<p>
 				<br>
 				<p>I don't think there is anything I would want to add
 				to this visualization, as it shows exactly what I planned
 				it too, so anything extra would probably just "junk"
 				it up. If anything, I would add (as a hover effect, most
 				likely) the titles of the songs with "love" in them for
 				each year, but the only thing that would add would be
 				some trivia; it wouldn't affect the actual data.</p>
 				<br><br>
 			<h3>Frustration</h3>
 				<p>Is "everything" an answer choice for what frustrated me?
 				No. OK. I'll go with the biggest choice then: the line
 				graph. This thing was such a pain in the butt. When
 				we talked about data visualizations in class, this seemed
 				like a piece of cake, just get the data, plug it in some
 				code and <b>BAM</b> you're done! Not. a. chance.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>Using matplotlib was futile; no matter what "shape"
 				I had the data in, I couldn't get it to work. It just
 				plotted a <a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/synthesis-2/data-representation/">
 				rectangle</a>... I had no clue how to fix it, so I just
 				left it. Then I learned about Plotly.<p>
 				<br>
 				<p>Plotly saved my life. After seeing Emery use it for our
 				<a href="https://acdm-spring-2017.github.io/team2/"> team
 				project</a>, it seemed easy enough to use, so I tried it out.
 				I struggled a little bit at the beginning; I couldn't
 				figure out how to use my .ipynb file to plug lists into the
 				axes. But I figured it out, and then everything was cake.
 				A few lines of code and I had an awesome visualization.
 				When I saw the graph pop up on my screen, fully functional,
 				I literally jumped up and down in my room screaming because 
 				I was so excited. I felt like I was on top of the world.</p>
 				<br><br>
 			<h3>Pride</h3>
 				<p>This is a small victory in the grand scheme of things, 
 				but a huge one for me. For the revision of synthesis 2
 				and the final portfolio, <b>I finally figured out how to
 				use Github</b>. I was able to clone a repository, add things
 				to it, commit the changes, and push them back up to Github.
 				This has been something I struggled with all semester; it
 				seemed like no matter how exactly I followed the directions,
 				there was always some kind of error that I had no clue
 				what it meant. It was frustrating, but I was able to just
 				copy and paste the code directly into the site so I got by.<p>
 				<br>
 				<p>But boy were you right!! Using the terminal was so much
 				easier and faster and way less confusing in the long
 				run. It seems silly that I just now figured out
 				the first lesson(s) taught in the class, but I truly
 				didn't understand it at the time, so to finally know
 				how to use this, I feel unstoppable.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>In fact, I even used Github for an <a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/upgruv/">
 				"assignment"</a> when I applied for an internship
 				in an attempt to be unique. And <b>I got the job!</b>
 				So I will say, less begrudgingly than I would have just
 				a month ago, I will proudly be interning with 535 (a
 				division of Trib Total Media) this summer...thanks
 				to Github. I literally just laughed out loud.</p>
 				<br><br>
 			<h3>Revision</h3>
 				<p>You can look at my original try at synthesis 2
 				<a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/synthesis-2/data-representation/">
 				here</a>. I revised both the visualization itself
 				and the site where it was housed (and the statement,
 				obviously), which you can view more pleasurably
 				<a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/synthesis-2-revision/data-representation/">
 				here</a>. All the critique materials are in Box for
 				your reading pleasure.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>Don't worry, I'm sure this isn't the last
 				you'll be seeing of me, I'll be back! Thanks for
 				always being awesome, Matt!</p>
